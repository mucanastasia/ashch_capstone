# Aka Momiji Lounge - Website & Table Reservation

This repository hosts the front-end project for the Aka Momiji Lounge, a fictional restaurant, created as the final project for the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate course. This project serves to demonstrate my web development skills on my journey to become a front-end developer.
